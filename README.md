# Noise_Detector
An implementation of a noise detector on an breadboard for UNLV EE 221L Circuit ll Laboratory final project

# Overview
For the EE 221L final project, a noise detector was designed and tested on an breadboard and  LTSpice.Created a noise detector, using circuit 2 and circuit 2 lab. The purpose of the   detector is to detect noise levels. If the noise level is high a green steady LED turns on.   When the red LED is lit, there is no noise at all. If there is a medium noise level the green LED blinks, if low noise level the green LED blinks slowly.
